# Railway_Subway_Metro_System

**Simulates a real life Railway / Subway / Metro system and the entities involved using multithreading. Just set the number of persons, trains and their speeds, list of stations, lines and see this system _come_ _alive_ using the power of threads.**

## Entities :

### Person (Thread) :

Abstracts a real life Person.
Persons are assigned random start and destination stations. Person enters station accordingly and waits for train to arrive. When train arrives person checks if he can enter train based on his destination and train capacity and then decides to enter train or not. Once in train, the person waits for train announcement and exits when the train reaches his destination.

### Train (Thread) :

Abstracts a real life Train.
Trains run to and fro between stations in their respective lines multiple times. Once train reaches station it announces for persons in train that the station has arrived. Before entering station checks if there is vacancy available in station. If not available then waits till another train moves out.

### Station :

Abstracts a real life Station.
Station lets person know that train has arrived. Station tells train whether vacancy is available.

### Line :

Abstracts a real life Railway / Subway / Metro Line.
Line contains multiple stations. Train goes to the stations in the order defined by the line. Lines can be used to represent slow / express trains or different routes altogether.

## Asynchronous Logger

This is a simple asynchronous logger that logs info about trains, persons, stations and exceptions to the log file.

## Intersection

This class is work in progress.

## Notes

Currently in the input files I have used stations from Western line (Mumbai Suburban Railway) and Central line (Mumbai Suburban Railway).
But this code can be easily extended to NYC MTA System or BART system in SFO.
